# sim800

C++ library to drive the SIM800 chip and ESP32.

I wrote this code to make sure we can send and retrieve data using the chip
with minimal RAM and Flash impact. Additionally this class contains code to
safely shutdown and wake up the SIM800.

The example contains the necessary initialization code as well as how to
retrieve a URL using HTTP GET. It does not, however, retrieve the body of
the response. To do so is very simple and uses the Arduino Stream class.

Apart from the GET request, you can play with the AT commands of the SIM800
by connecting a serial console to your board.
